============= Installing MongoDB Server ===================

- www.mongodb.com -> Products -> Community edition
- During installation: 
	* Complete (Other is Custom)
	* Check (Install MongoDB as a Service)
	* Run service as Network Service user
	* Check: (Install MondoDB Compass)

- Verify installation:
	* Check windows 'Services' for "MongoDB Server (MongoDB)" to be running.

========= ALTERNATIVELY, RUN IN FOREGROUND, NOT BACKGROUND (If you decide not to do the above method. I use and recommend the above method) ==========
- Add to path: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin	(check in cmd: mongod --version)
- cmd (Admin) > mongod --dbpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.0\data" --logpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.0\log\mongod.log" -logappend


=============== Two tools for interacting with MongoDB server are; Mongo Shell & MongoDB Compass ===========

---- 1. Mongo shell ------
	- Google for and install mongodb shell: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
	- In cmd > mongosh
	- More in 01.txt



=============== MONGODB ATLAS ===========
Alternative to using the system installed mongodb server, you can use the cloud hosted known as Atlas.

- Googe search mongodb atlas and login: https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?nds=true
- Create a project and give it a name, ie; "Express Demo Database", Next and Create Project
- Click Create Cluster button:
	- Choose the free server
	- Give cluster name or leave as default, 'Cluster0'
	- Choose any cloud provider. (I chose Google Cloud)
	- Choose region (Or leave as default)
	- Click "Create Deployment" button
	- Give username and password, ie root, Abcd1234
	- Create Database user
	- Click "Choose a Connection Method"
		NB: Henceforth below, it is in relation to working with Express JS
	- Select 'Drivers'
	- Dropdown Driver: 'Mongoose', Version: Latest (i.e 7.0) or later
	- npm install mongoose
	- Copy the connection string (Check Show Password), ie:
		mongodb+srv://admin:Admin123@cluster0.7kmpciu.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
	- Done
	- Go to 'Network Access' on the left navigation section
	- An IP Address is given. (This means that you can access the database ONLY from that IP Address, which is not okay)
	- Click on Edit button, Click on "ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE" and Confirm. Now we can easily access it.
